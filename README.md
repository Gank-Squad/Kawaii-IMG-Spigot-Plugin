# Kawaii-IMG-Spigot-Plugin

- This plugin basically allows you to **render images in Minecraft** (version: 1.19.2) based on a list of blocks with attributed R,G,B values. 
- The way the player selects where to render the image is by hitting a specific block with a `Golden Axe`, from here the coords of that selected block will be stored in JSON file of `{player : selectedBlock}` pairs.
- The image is rendered via this command which is preformed by the Player with adequate permissions: <br/> `/image <Image FileName> <Sample Text FileName> <Orientation>`
